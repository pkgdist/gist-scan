# @softdist/gist-scanner

**Scan your GitHub Gists for secrets, high-entropy tokens, regex patterns, and terms.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This project is in early alpha.  It can be reliably cloned and run with the "make run" command, on linux systems or those with Makefile support.  We are currently iterating on improving the pagination features and speed.

## Examples

### 1. Search for a specific term in Gists:

```bash
gist-scan --term "password"
```

---

### 2. Search for a regex pattern (e.g., AWS Access Key):

```bash
gist-scan --regex "AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}"
```

---

### 3. Scan for high-entropy secrets like tokens, JWTs, and hashes:

```bash
gist-scan --secrets
```

---

### 4. Combine search for a specific term and delete matched gists (with confirmation):

```bash
gist-scan --term "password" --delete
```

---

### 5. Automatically delete all matched gists (without confirmation):

```bash
gist-scan --term "password" --delete --yes
```

---

### 6. Combine regex pattern search and secret scanning:

```bash
gist-scan --regex "my-api-key-\d+" --secrets
```

---

## Environment Variables
